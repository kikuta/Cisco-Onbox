# Enjoy IOS XE hidden options
* According to the release note of 16.8.1a, "Accessing Hidden Commands" is documented as a new feature. Now hidden command options will be exposed if "service internal" is configured.
* [Release note](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9300/software/release/16-8/release_notes/ol-16-8-9300.html#id_65400)
* "service internal" should not be configured as a default because it is almost for testing, trouble shooting, or evaluation.
* This script is for us who are just interested in hidden options. Easy to know how many and what kind of hidden options are available with the IOS XE booted.
* Having fun is important eventhough it is meaningless technically. If it is hidden, we want to know what it is. Enjoy!
